Corrected internal definitions for the data declared in fixdata_app.h.
SCR#21887: Removed check for "T" value must be equal to 1 for all TDn ATR bytes

 or B) for multi-voltage terminals.  When this byte is present in the ATR, the
 TD3 byte must contain a "T" value of 15 (F), which was causing the terminal to
 reject the card.

 definition.
On PIN and PRT devices changed setting for HC_ErrorChar to 0x80, so it is
 possible to transmit binary zeroes through the CAT33 and like protocols in
 7E1 mode.

 mode.
Corrected return value for sockets in case socket subsystem is not initialized.

 passed to D2100.

Version A25

Added protection against formatting or opening FFS in supervisor mode.
Corrected flow control setting (disable) for HEMS modules.
Added TERMMKAutoErase field to TERM table.
Finally removed all __packed definitions from all HSDK header files. It is
 obsolete definition for compatibility with ADS and since ADS is no longer
 supported it was cleaned out. The application receiving error/warnings can
 safely define __packed to empty or just remove it from application source
 code.
